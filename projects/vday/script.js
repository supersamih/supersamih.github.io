Judging from what little of the conversation Nataly was able to understand, it appeared that he was giving the young man relationship advice. Evidently, this mysterious ‘G’ was both the tribe’s chief engineer and chief counselor. 

    ‘Yo, guests,’ he spoke. ‘How are you today bro?’
    ‘Not so great, actually,’ Nataly replied. ‘We kinda barely survived a flaming shipwreck and then almost died making our way here.’
    ‘Oh. That sucks man.’
    His voice growing serious, the sage explained: ‘You’re not the first to crash here, and you won’t be the last. The evil wizard who lives in the tower rules this land, and he kills all outlanders he sees. The only reason he leaves us is because we don’t bother him anymore. Every time we tried to storm his tower, we were helpless to do anything.’
    Nataly and Naseem’s faces fell, realising the difficulty of the task that faced them ahead.
  ‘Don’t worry. There’s still a chance. The prophecies of our tribe tell of the brave foreign heroes who will defeat the wizard one day. But only the truly worthy can overcome the trial needed to wield the legendary blade of our tribe the Infinity Edge. None among us has yet been able to succeed.’
    Shifting his weight, he continued.
    ‘If you’d rather not take the risk, the tribe is willing to arm you both with spears and our glorious leader Moka has kindly offered to send scout leader Glimpee with you, or even accompany you herself.’

Atop the tower a large crystal glowed a deep purple hue, pulsing regularly. Surely it must be the source of whatever had pulled the S.S. Chee-z towards the island and onto the rocks. Clutching her fists, Nataly vowed to make the one responsible pay for the disaster. As the group began to climb the steps of the tower, the gigantic stone doors which lay at the top began to slowly swing open, as if it was welcoming them. At the same moment, a booming voice rang out:

Recalling the weapon that they had won from the Pepega clan, Nataly reached down to the scabbard and drew the legendary blade. It shone with a brilliant light as the zombies approached, and she swung, a beam of light cutting down three of the creatures at once. Another slash turned three more of the beasts to dust, and even with their rudimentary leftover intelligence the others began to back away in fear of the weapon’s holy power. Meanwhile, Naseem’s tinkering had freed the door lock, and the two dashed through in the reprieve.

    Awaiting them at the very summit of the tower, standing beneath the enormous crystal, was the dark-robed wizard. Lightning flared in the sky above as storm clouds once again gathered around the island. The man turned, his deranged face briefly illuminated by the flash of a lightning bolt. His face was ancient, ravaged and disfigured by the passage of time and his long imprisonment on the island. 
    ‘My name is Pogge’, the old man spoke. ‘I, too, was once like you. I washed up on this island hundreds of years ago, and found myself surrounded by nothing but these animals. Not a single person ever came to look for me. It was all I could do to survive apart from them for many years before I was able to construct this tower.’
    He walked towards the crystal, raising his hand in admiration at his own work. ‘After decades I was able to finish the crystal you see before you. It lures in ships like yours, pulling them into the rocks, where I can easily gather bodies for my simp army. One day I’ll be able to salvage enough material to finally leave this place, and then I’ll avenge myself on the entire world for not searching for me.’
    ‘You’re a crazy old man and I’ll never simp for you’ Nataly responded.
    ‘Shuddup Nataly’
    ‘Shuddup Pogge’
    ‘SHUDDUP NATALY’
    ‘SHUDDUP POGGE’
    With that, the dark wizard began channeling a spell.
